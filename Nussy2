# In this program

#I have a sample dataset students_data, which contains information about students.
# I used list comprehension to create a list of names (names_list), then used set comprehension to create a tuple of unique majors (majors_tuple).
# I use set comprehension to create a set of unique ages (ages_set) and performed some basic analysis on the dataset, such as counting the number of students, the number of unique names, the number of unique majors, and calculating the average age.
# Lastly, the result of the analysis was printed.
